Semantic HTML plays a crucial role in web development, providing meaning to the web content beyond the presentation layer. This article explores the core benefits of using semantic elements.

Improved Accessibility

By using elements like &lt;header&gt; &lt;nav&gt; , and &lt;footer&gt; developers can create more accessible websites for people using screen readers and other assistive technologies.

SEO Benefits

Semantic markup improves the SEO of web pages by allowing search engines to better understand the content structure, leading to potentially higher rankings in search results.
